** Claudemacs Startup Code
Note: This is the startup command for claudemacs itself, not for claudemacs-client.
Specifically, it starts as "claude", do not start "claude" with "claude --resume [sessionId]".

Note: If you want to use "claude --resume [sessionId]", that is claudemacs's domain,
so refer to claudemacs documentation or define your own command.
This is kept here as a personal memo but is not necessarily maintained.
- Use M-x cd to specify the directory where you want to open a session.
- Actually open any file in that directory.
- Run the claudemacs-transient-menu command and select "Start with Resume".

(start-claudemacs-new-session)

Note: This layout uses split-window-right as the author's preference.
Customize this block for your desired window layout.
